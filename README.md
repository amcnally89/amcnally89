- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amcnally89
- Below you will find the code that I am attempting to use for the R Capstone Project. It appears that there is an warning with the test_results_all predict. But the main issue that I am having is with the RSQ and RSME functions.

train_fit_all %>%
     mutate(name = fct_reorder(labels(train_fit_all$fit$coefficients), train_fit_all$fit$coefficients)) %>%
     ggplot( aes(x=fit, y=coefficients)) +
     geom_bar()
